Project 2 of ENGI 301 - PCB Design
Here, I will create PCB files for a USB Music Player that is described in project_01 in this Github repository. I will be creating a board that contains the PocketBeagle, 4 buttons, LCD screen, and USB Port.
Briefly, the USB music player will allow a user to plug in a USB to a powered USB hub, which will then display the songs on the USB onto a TFT LCD Screen. Then, the user can select the song they wish to play with the up/down buttons, and play/pause the music with the play and pause buttons.
